## <U>Password Strength Classifier:<\U>
<li>The primary focus of this project is to provide knowledge to the user about how Strong is the password which the user is likely to use for their security.<\li>
<li>Here the concept of Natural Language Processing and Machine is being used.<\li>
<li>Here TF - IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency), an NLP technique is being used to Preprocess the text data into vectors for ML models.<\li>
<li>XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is being used for more accurate performance.<\li>
